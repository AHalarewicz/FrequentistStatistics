# FrequentistStatistics
Introduction to concepts like t- and z-tests, how to calculate standard deviation from a sample, and the Central Limit Theorem, and get some hands-on practice working with these concepts using simulated normal data.


Objectives:

  -Learn to calculate probabilities from probability density functions.
  
  -Learn how and when to calculate descriptive statistics and test statistics.
  
  -Learn how the central limit theorem applies to sampling distributions.
  
  -Learn to calculate confidence intervals and p-values.
  
  -Learn to apply these steps to perform hypothesis testing on real data.
