# FrequentistStatistics
Introduction to concepts like t- and z-tests, how to calculate standard deviation from a sample, and the Central Limit Theorem, and get some hands-on practice working with these concepts using simulated normal data.

# Summary
Objectives:

  -Learn to calculate probabilities from probability density functions.
  
  -Learn how and when to calculate descriptive statistics and test statistics.
  
  -Learn how the central limit theorem applies to sampling distributions.
  
  -Learn to calculate confidence intervals and p-values.
  
  -Learn to apply these steps to perform hypothesis testing on real data.
  
  
 
Demonstrate an understanding of:
  
  -the z-statistic
  
  -the t-statistic
  
  -the difference and relationship between the two
  
  -the Central Limit Theorem, including its assumptions and consequences
  
  -how to estimate the population mean and standard deviation from a sample
  
  -the concept of a sampling distribution of a test statistic, particularly for the mean
  
  -how to combine these concepts to calculate a confidence interval
  
  -how those confidence intervals and p-values allow you to perform hypothesis (or A/B) tests
